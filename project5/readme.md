## by Jasmin Cabaravdic


## Dataset

 Bay Wheel's data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. All data is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html">here</a> as monthly datasets. Data for 2019 year will be downloaded and merged to one dataset.


## Summary of Findings

- There are some outliers on duration distribution and  we should limit x axis values to 60 minutes. 
- Distribution is right skewed
- Avarege bike ride duration is 12.92 minutes and maximum bike ride duration is 1437 minutes
- Most of users ride a bike during workdays
- Highest bike rides numbers are in March,April and October, and as we would expect least usage is in December
- Most of Bay Wheels users come from Subscriber group. These are regular customers
- Majority of users do not share their rides
- Subscribers ride bikes for shorter period of time then Customers type of users
- Users tend to ride bike for longer time period during weekend
- On weekend both type of users ride bike for longer time
- In December, both type of users ride bike for shorter time period, while during the rest of the year Customers tend to ride bike longer

## Key Insights for Presentation


- It looks like mostly peoply use bikes on working days. We can assume the purpose of bike sharing service is to get to the work
- From the boxplot we can see that users who are subscribers ride bikes for shorter period of time then customers type of users.
Subscribers are regular users, people who use bike-sharing service on daily basis, so they know route to their destination. Knowing trip route shortens bike ride duration.
